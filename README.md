#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing, development, testing and maintenance of software systems applying engineering principes to create reliable and scalable software which meets its users' needs. 
The importance of software engineering in the tech industry as it drives innovation and technological adavancements. Furthermore, software engineering aids in problem solving through innvative solutions. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The software crisis (1960s)- The crisis happened as a result of increasing in complexity of computers which ensured the software projects were often over budget and behind schedule and produced unreliable software. This lead to the birth of software engineering to get the projects back on track. 
The rise of object-oriented programming (1980s)- This new paradigm provided a structured approach to building complex systems based on OOP Principles such as C++, Java and Python. 
The Agile manifesto (2001)- This was developed by a group of software engineers which promoted flxibility, adaptability and customer focus which increased project success rates and software quality. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning and Requirement analysis which involves defining the project scope, conducting feasibility studies and defining the software's purpose, festures and functionalities based on the end user's needs. In this stage, a project plan is created including the timelines, budget, resources required and risk assessment. 
2. Design where the requirements for the project are translated into a blueprint where the developers have decided on the system architecture, user interfaces and technologies that will be used. 
3. Development and Coding where the actual coding takes place based on the design specifications ensuring that the code adheres to established guidelines and standards. 
4. Testing where the developers rigorously test the software to identify and fix erros while ensuring the software meets all requiremnts and is free from critical bugs before deploying the software. 
5. Deployment which is the actual rollout through phases or a full launch to the production environment. 
6. Maintenance where bugs are fixed, modified to the adaptations in the environment and adding new features to ensure it continues to meet the users needs. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology has a clearly defined project scope which is done upfront while the agile methodology evolves over time.
Waterfall methodology has distinct and sequential phases while Agile methodology has iterative and incremental phases.
Waterfall methodology is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes such as developing a complex embedded system with strict regulatory compliance requirements while Agile methodology is suitable for projects with uncertain requirements or rapdily changing markets such as developing a mobile app where user preferences and market trends are constantly evolving. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes and tests out the code, troubleshoots and debug applications, adhering to coding standards and best practices.
Quality assurance engineer- developing test cases and test plans, executing test cases and reporting defects and ensuring software meets quality standards. 
Project manager- defines the project scope and goals, creating project plans and timelines, managing project budget and resources and coordinating with all relevant stakeholders. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- Increase productivity as they offer features such as code completion, syntax highlighting and debugging tools that increase developer efficiency; Visual studio code and IntelliJ IDEA
VCS- Enhance collaboration as multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflict while recording the changes made over time which makes it possile to keep track of who made which changes and when they were made. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancements which makes it difficult to stay updated with the latest technology. Developers should be open to continuous learning and attend workshops to ensure they keep upto date.
Changing requirements which require constant adaptation to eveolving project requirements. Developers need to adopt Agile methodologies with flexible planning.
Identifying and resolving sofware defects and complex issues. Developers need to have a systematic debugging approaches using debugging tools. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the individual units of code which verifies if each unit works as expected in isolation. It is important in the early detection of defects and facilitating integration testing.
Integration testing which focuses on the interactions between different software components or modules which ensures that components work seamlessly together. It is important in identifying interface defects and ensures data flows correctly. 
System testing verifies if the system software functions as a complete product and that it meets specified requirements. It is important in assessing system performance, usability, security and compatibility.
Acceptance testing focuses the software's alignment with user requirements and objectives. It ensures customer satisfaction, validates the software's fitness for its intended purpose and reduces risk of post-release defects. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.
Prompt engineering is important as it ensures the responses are accurate and relevant and improve efficiency as it saves on time. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Kindly write about Business Ethics 
Improved prompt- Kindly explain the effect of Business Ethics on Company performance using case studies.
This prompt is improved as it specifies the parameters for the AI, ensuring a more relevant and focused output. Furthermore, it provides a clearer criteria for the evaluation of Business ethics. It also clearly outlines the desired type of relevant practical examples.
